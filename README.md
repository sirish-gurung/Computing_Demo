1.	What is the URL to your GitHub-Pages site? <br />
https://github.com/sirish-gurung/Computing_Demo

2.	What API did you use and why? <br />
I used one of the news API (https://github.com/cyberboysumanjay/Inshorts-News-API) because there were dataâ€™s that could be filtered easily.

3.	What are some other applications for your API other than searching? Name a few and describe how an app using it for that purpose might work. <br />
Some of the other applications for the API I used were; to display a short news, display a short news by date, display a short news by author and many more.

4.	Explain the considerations you needed to make for the website to be responsive & mobile-friendly. <br />
Used responsive elements such as bootstrap, and media queries. 

5.	How can you make your app accessible to people with disabilities such as blindness or colorblindness? <br />
We could use functions such as voice over text and using color scheme toggle for different kind of color blindness. 

6.	If you could make further changes to your project to improve/expand the experience, what would they be and how would you go about implementing them? <br />
If I could further improve/ expand my project, I would add more UI/UX components to make the webpage beautiful. I would also use material UI to make the UI consistent throughout the website. Furthermore, I would connect it to a database.
